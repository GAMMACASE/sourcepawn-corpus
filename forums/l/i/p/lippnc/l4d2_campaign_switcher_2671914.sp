	This plugin was written in response to the server kicking everyone if the vote is not passed
	at the end of the campaign. It will automatically switch to the appropriate map at all the
	points a vote would be automatically called, by the game, to go to the lobby or play again.
	ACS also includes a voting system in which people can vote for their favorite campaign/map
	on a finale or scavenge map.  The winning campaign/map will become the next map the server
	loads.

		Coop
		Realism
		Versus
		Team Versus
